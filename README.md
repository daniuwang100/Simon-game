## README for Assembly Simon Game

### Introduction
This project is an assembly language program designed for an interactive LED sequence game. It demonstrates low-level programming skills and direct hardware manipulation.

### File Description
- **Project.s**: The main assembly source file. It contains data definitions, user interaction strings, and the main logic for the LED sequence game.

### Building and Running the Project
1. Ensure you have an assembler (like NASM, GAS) compatible with your system.
2. Assemble the program using your assembler. For example: `nasm -f elf Project.s`
3. Link the object file and run the executable.

### Features
- Generation of random LED sequences.
- User interaction for game replay and difficulty selection.
- Direct hardware interaction for LED control.

### Development Notes
- The main logic in `main` includes a TODO for LED handling.
- Strings for user interaction indicate options for replay and difficulty settings.

### Future Improvements
- Complete the LED control logic.
- Enhance user interaction and feedback mechanisms.
